# Prodigy_DS_05
I'm excited to share my latest project on Analyzing Traffic Accident Data to Identify Patterns Related to Road Conditions, Weather, and Time of Day. This project was completed as part of my work with Prodigy Infotech. The primary goal was to understand the contributing factors to traffic accidents and visualize accident hotspots to improve road safety.

## Project Overview
In this project, I utilized Python and several powerful data analysis libraries, including Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Folium, to conduct a comprehensive analysis of traffic accident data. Here‚Äôs an overview of the steps involved:

### **Data Collection üìÇ**:
- Gathered traffic accident data from public databases and government sources.
- Sample Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshalbhamare/us-accident-eda
  
### **Data Preprocessing üßπ**:
- Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and creating relevant features.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üßê**:
- Examined the data to identify patterns and trends related to road conditions, weather, and time of day.
- Used statistical methods to quantify the relationships between different variables and accident severity.

### **Data Visualization üìä**:
- Created visualizations to illustrate the distribution of accidents across different conditions and times.
- Utilized heatmaps and geographical plots to identify accident hotspots.
- Visualized contributing factors such as road type, weather conditions, and time of day using bar plots and line charts.

### **Insights and Recommendations üß†**:
- Identified key factors contributing to traffic accidents and provided recommendations for improving road safety.
- Highlighted the importance of specific road and weather conditions in accident prevention.
